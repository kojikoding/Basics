What is your favorite programming language? Why?

My favorite programming language is C. It is similar to Java, the first language I ever learned, but also feels much closer to source code. I feel I have more control and that makes it more fun than other languages.

Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

I am not most experienced with C, but Java. I have the most experience in Java since I have used it the longest.
